# computer-vision
This repo contains some basic low-level Computer Vision algorithms implemented in a Jupyter notebook using numpy and a little OpenCV.

Algorithms:
  - Grayscale resolution.
  - Variance based thresholding (Otsu, 1979).
  - Entropy based thresholding (Kapur et al., 1985).
  - Line Hough transform.
  - Circle Hough transform.
  - Custom BFS-based segmentation algorithm.
